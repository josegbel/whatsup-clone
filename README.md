# WhatsApp Clone App

Welcome to the repository of our WhatsApp Clone App! This project is an ambitious attempt to replicate the core functionalities of the widely popular messaging service, WhatsApp, focusing on real-time messaging, push notifications, and an intuitive user interface.

## Tech Stack

This application is built using a modern and efficient stack designed to deliver a smooth and responsive user experience on both iOS and Android platforms:

- **React Native**: Used as the core framework for building the mobile application. React Native allows us to write native-like applications using JavaScript and React.
- **React Native Navigation**: Handles in-app navigation, ensuring a fluid and intuitive flow between different screens and functionalities.
- **Redux**: Manages the global state of the application. This is crucial for handling real-time updates and maintaining a consistent state across the app.
- **Firebase**:
  - **Authentication**: Manages user authentication, providing a secure and hassle-free login experience.
  - **Push Notifications**: Keeps users engaged and informed by sending timely notifications.
  - **Storage**: Used for storing media like images and videos securely in the cloud.
  - **Realtime Database**: Facilitates real-time messaging by syncing data across users instantly and efficiently.

## Code Quality and Standards

To maintain high code quality and ensure a consistent coding style across the project, we employ the following tools and specifications:

- **Prettier**: An opinionated code formatter that supports many languages and integrates with most editors. We use Prettier to automatically format our code to meet certain stylistic guidelines, helping to keep our codebase clean and readable.

- **Conventional Commits**: Our repository follows the Conventional Commits specification for all commit messages. This specification provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history, which makes it easier to write automated tools on top of and helps us to manage the release process more efficiently.
